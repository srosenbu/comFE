# comFE
A library for _**co**nstitutive **m**odels in **FE**niCSx_ written in Rust and Python.

## Goals

* My side project which should have a similar functionality as https://github.com/BAMresearch/fenics-constitutive. (BUT IN RUST)
* Currently this repo just reserves the name on github (naming stuff is hard)

## Rstrictions

* This is my personal Rust-Learning project, therefore don't expect anything groundbreaking.

## Installing

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install `mamba`
3. `mamba env create -f environment.yml`
